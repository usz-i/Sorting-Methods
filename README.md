# Sorting-Methods
List of Sorrting method
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort

Purpose:
  To study and understand the Big-O notation of multiple sorting algorithms.
  All the sorting algorithms performed differently based on the size of the array. 
  For example, Selection sort and Insertion sort made use of nested loops which makes
  them have the Big-O notation of O(n^2) making them more suitable for an array with a 
  smaller size. On the other hand, both merge sort and quick sort are more efficient in
  sorting an array with a bigger size due to them having a Big-O notation of O(n lg N).
